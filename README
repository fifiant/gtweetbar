Testing:
========

   If you wish to try out grab the tarball, extract it, goto the extracted folder 
   and simply issue the following -
   
      $ chmod u+x ./install.sh
      $ sudo ./install.sh
      
   Now, to try out in a window - $ python ./gtweetbar.py run-in-window
   To add to your gnome panel, right-click on a panel, choose Add to Panel, and
   select Gnome TweetBar from the list.
   
   ***
   However if you do not wish to run a suspicious install.sh under root,
   you can easily test it by uncommenting line 13 in gtweetbar.py and running it
   as
    
      $ python ./gtweetbar.py run-in-window
   
   First time it would ask you for twitter credentials.
   
   *NOTE - A lot more needs to be done so don't get frustated, do send some
            useful feedback though

Todo:
=====

    [+] gtk.gdk.Color() doesn't take "#XXXXXX" format on old gtk - 
        as seen on Ubuntu 8.10 lts running python 2.5.x
        - replaced by gtk.gdk.color_parse
    [+] #91 txtUsername.set_text() can't take None
    [+] Enter key in preferences window should do the job
    [ ] Some kind of alert for invalid credentials
    [+] more organized code, more comments
    [+] twitter's cyanish color...
    [ ] alerts for failed tweets...
    [ ] loads of exception handling here and there
    [+] safe and easy testing without hassles of install.sh
    [+] height issues resolved to keeping it defualt
    [+] http://paste.debian.net/48776 to be looked into
        - made INSTALL_PATH more universal, now one can try without installing
    [+] issue #1 http://github.com/ideamonk/gtweetbar/issues/#issue/1
        - main_window.set_resizable(False) did it :)
